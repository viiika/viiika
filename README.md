# Hi, I'm Jinbin Bai ðŸ‘‹

I design algorithms and build models to help artists and designers create cool things. My research focuses on **image generation** and **unified generative architectures** before.

See [MeissonFlow Research](https://huggingface.co/MeissonFlow) (Organization Card) for more about my research journey.

I also share thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jinbin_Bai).
